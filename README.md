The model is structured in layers which comprise LSTM cells. These are a type of neural network layer that has been engineered to work well with data that comes in series, such as days and the prices of stock on those days. They are termed "Long Short-Term Memory" in that they retain relevant and beneficial data for extended periods of time while discarding irrelevant information. If you want to forecast how much the stocks will cost tomorrow, you do not have to bother knowing every little detail, but you do need to remember about the trends that are relevant within, for example, the last couple of days or weeks. In this paper, I have applied LSTM techniques to train the model, LSTM by the default, and setting of the prediction scope with the use of historical data of Yahoo finance stock market from 1/1/2014 to 1/10/2024. RMSE and MAPE metrics have been used to validate the prediction performance of models. The main aim of the current paper is to find prediction accuracy of LSTM neural networks, applied to short term ranges of prediction, to identify whether the LSTM model holds certain advantages over the other machine learning algorithms. This model utilizes the yahoo finance dataset for stocks data that contains high,close,open,low,volume and adjcent close of a stock.
