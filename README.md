The model is arranged in layers which contain LSTM cells. These types of cells are a kind of neural network layer that has been engineered to work well with data that comes in series, 
such as days and the prices of stock on those days. They are termed “Long Short-Term Memory” in that they retain relevant and beneficial data for extended periods of time while discarding irrelevant information. 
If you want to predict how much the stocks will cost tomorrow, you do not need to bother with knowing every little detail, but you do have to keep in mind about the trends that are relevant within for example the last couple of days or weeks.
In this paper, I have applied LSTM techniques to train the model, LSTM, by setting the prediction scope and using the historical data of Yahoo finance stock market from 1/1/2014 to 1/10/2024 by default, as the original data for short-term prediction. The prediction performance of the models is evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).The main objective of this paper is to find the prediction accuracy of LSTM neural network models applied to short-term prediction ranges and to see whether the LSTM model shows certain advantages, compared to other machine learning algorithms.
This model uses the dataset from yahoo finance for stocks data including high,close,open,low,volume and adjcent close of a stock.
